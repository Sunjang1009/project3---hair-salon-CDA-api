# Problem solving 
As a small business owner, it is important for me to maintain strong relationships with my clients through my app. The app will serve as a platform where I can access and manage client information, including the ability to edit and delete records, which will be stored in my MongoDB database. In the future, I plan to expand the functionality of the app to allow clients to access it as well. This will enable them to conveniently adjust their appointment dates and even simulate different hairstyles using their own pictures. Through the app, clients will receive detailed information about their desired hairstyles, including pricing, required time, and other relevant details. By integrating this feature, clients will have a clearer understanding of the services I offer and can make informed decisions based on their preferences.

# User experience.

2. Frontend : As a user, I should be albe to add, edit, delete my client data from APP
3. Beautiful and practical CSS
